# Dev Folder - Usage Guidelines

- Contains tools and pages for local development only.
- Should NOT be inside `src/routes` in production.
- To use locally, move the tool folder into `src/routes`.
- Use the tools as pages.
- After use, **move it back to this `dev` folder before pushing to git or production**.

## `forge` folder

- Tool to modify or add icons in `src/lib/library/icoglyphsDB.json`.

Please follow these steps to keep production clean.  
This setup is temporary until the icoglyphs project updates its database or finds a simpler solution.
