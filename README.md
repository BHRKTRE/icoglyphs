## What Makes IcoGlyphs Different?

Most web icon libraries rely on figurative representations, which are therefore influenced by cultural, linguistic, and temporal factors. The core principle of IcoGlyphs is to **transcend figurative illustrations to describe concepts**.

While a home icon (🏠) on a landing page might work well in Western society, particularly in the English language, to mean "home" as a figurative translation in the spoken language, it doesn’t, for example, effectively convey the concept of a starting point or origin. The term "home" is not universally meaningful across cultures, and its meaning can vary significantly.
The right icon should capture the core concept—a starting point or foundation—something universal and timeless.

IcoGlyphs focuses on creating icons that align with these fundamental concepts, ensuring they can be universally understood across different cultures, based on shapes and ideas that transcend geographical and linguistic boundaries.

However, some classic icons, like arrows (⬆️) or the "no entry" sign (⛔), are already perfectly accurate. In other cases where a depiction is essential to the concept, such as a cat icon representing a cat, figurative icons make sense.
