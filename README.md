# [IcoGlyphs](https://icoglyphs.com/)

Let's leverage the global need for icons to develop a **universal language** for everyone 🚀

## What Makes IcoGlyphs Different?

While actual icon libraries rely on figurative representations (and are therefore obviously dictated by cultural, linguistic, and temporal factors). **Our core principle is to avoid figurative representations**, except in cases where such a depiction is essential to the concept, such as a cat icon to represent a cat. We aim and focus on creating icons that convey **universal concepts**.

For example, while a home icon (🏠) might work well in Western contexts, particularly in English, to represent "Home" as a figurative translation of the spoken language, it doesn’t effectively convey the concept of a starting point or origin. The term "home" is not universally accurate across different cultures, and its meaning can vary significantly depending on cultural context. Not all homes look like the typical Western house, and in some cultures, "home" may be represented by something entirely different. Instead of relying on literal, culturally-specific representations, the right icon should represent the core concept of a starting point or foundation—something universal and timeless. IcoGlyphs focuses on creating icons that align with these fundamental concepts, ensuring they can be universally understood across different cultures, based on shapes and ideas that transcend geographical and linguistic boundaries.

But we don’t aim to reinvent the wheel; some classic icons, like arrows (⬆️) or the "no entry" sign (⛔), are already perfectly accurate.
